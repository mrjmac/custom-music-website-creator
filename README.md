# custom-music-website-creator

This tool will automatically generate a website that you can listen to music on.

To use this tool:
 * Clone the repo
 * Create a music folder in the same location as the "runme.java" file
 * Add mp3 files of all the songs that you want to be on your website
 * Change the file names of those songs to the name of the song itself
 * Run the program
 
This will leave you with a custom HTML file that will function just as the one on my personal website here:

https://mrjmac.github.io/music.html

 The difference is that yours will have your own songs.
 
 You can proceed to host the html file on GitHub pages or any other web hosting server. Make sure to include the music folder and the following files: music.html, script.js, style.css, and vinyl.png (although you can swap this out for whatever you want).
